# croc â€“ You never stop learning

This repository is a collection of library classes written by me, mainly for an educational purpose. I try to get them clean, well tested and documented. My target are correctly working classes written in good C++. 

Feel free to copy, change, share, etc. 

I always love to hear critique to improve my style.
